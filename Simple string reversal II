In this Kata, you will be given a string and two indexes. Your task is to reverse the portion of that string between those two indices inclusive.

solve("codewars",1,5) = "cawedors" -- elements at index 1 to 5 inclusive are "odewa". So we reverse them.
solve("cODEWArs", 1,5) = "cAWEDOrs" -- to help visualize.
Input will be lowercase and uppercase letters only.





function solve(st,a,b){
 var x = st.substring(a,b+1).split("").reverse().join("")
 return (st.replace(st.substring(a,b+1), x))
}
