Task:
Leo's girlfriend asked him to buy a gift list during his next trip, now he wants to know how many of them will he be able to buy.

Write the following function to help Leo out:

function howManyGifts(maxBudget, gifts)
The first parameter is Leo's budget; he second one is an array (a list in Groovy) containing the price of each gift. You should return an integer representing the maximum amount of gifts Leo can buy.

Example:
Maximum budget: 20
Gift List: [13, 2, 4, 6, 1]
Should return 4.

NOTE: All numbers will be integers >= 0, and the array will never be empty.





function howManyGifts(maxBudget, gifts){
  var counter = 0
  var amount = 0
  gifts = gifts.sort(function(a,b){return a-b})
    for(var i=0;i<gifts.length;i++){
      if(amount + gifts[i] <= maxBudget) { 
      amount+=gifts[i]
      counter++
      }
    }
  return counter
}
